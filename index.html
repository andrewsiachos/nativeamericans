            <h2><u>The Native Americans</u></h2>
            <div class="info">
                <p>Native Americans, also known as <i>American Indians, Indians, Indigenous Americans</i>
                    are the indigenous peoples of the United States. There are over 500 federally
                     recognized tribes within the U.S. The term used here excludes the Native Hawaiians
                     and some Alaska Natives.

                    The ancestors of modern Native Americans in what is now the United States at least
                    15.000 years ago,possibly much longer from Asia and Beringia. Native Americans were
                    greatly affected by the European Colonization of the Americas, which began in 1492,
                    and their population declined precipitously due to introduced diseases, warfare and slavery.
                    After the founding of the United States, many Native American people were subjected to warfare,
                    removals and one-side treaties and they continue to suffer from discriminatory government policies
                    into the 21st century.

                    Native Americans had become very accustomed with nature so they developed many theories about the spirits
                    of their ancestors described as energy highly connected with nature's elements. A very common tradition 
                    of the northern tribes is that their Ancestral Spirits live in the Northern Lights and can give them advice
                    and help if the people are in need. They also had many theories about the flowing water, the blowing wind 
                    relationships between the tribe and native animals of the region. You can find more on this at the Traditions
                    & Legends section.

            <h2><u>Tribal Structure</u></h2>
            <div class="info">
                <p>The structure of a tribe is as following:</p><br>
                <p>1)<u>Chief</u></p>
                <p>The Chief of a tribe is the tribe's leader. He was elected or chosen by the people.
                   Chiefs generally did not have total power(we will explain later), but were respected men
                   who provided advice that the tribe generally followed. Tribes may have both a civil leader
                   and a war leader(a.k.a. The Warchief). The civil leader leader guided the tribe during times of peace while the war 
                   leader guided the tribe during times of war. But in most tribes the civil leader and the war leader
                   were the same person.

                </figure><br><br>
                
                <p>2)<u>Shaman</u></p>
                <p>
                    The Shaman was the spiritual leader of the tribe. Sometimes he was the oldest person of the tribe and was considered
                    the wisest because of his knowledge. He was the spiritual leader of the tribe because he was the one who communicated
                    with the spirits of the ancestors, interpreted signs of nature and the one who advised the chief according to the information
                    taken from the spirits on difficult ocasions. The Shaman was also the doctor and the teacher of the tribe.

                    <figcaption><i>"Native American Shaman"</i></figcaption>
                </figure><br><br>
                
                <p>3)<u>Women and Men</u></p>
                <p>
                    Women and men had distinctly different roles in both daily work and in leadership. The chiefs, the leaders and the shamans
                    were always men, however, this does not mean that women were powerless. Their opinion was very well respected and they were
                    the leaders inside the home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What did Native Americans consider valuable?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Native Americans did not put value into material items. There was little in the way of possesions and ownership. Generally if
                    you made something it was yours but people didn't own land or collect money in the bank. They valued intangible things like respect,
                    honor and status.                   
                </p>
                <p>
                    So if they didn't have any means of ownsership such as land properties what rules did they have and what punishements corresponded to
                    when you broke those rules?
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a Native American tribe you had to respect every member in order to maintain the well-being of the tribe. No one was better than the other
                    even the leaders participated in the works that had to be done for the tribe. This is one of the main resons why Native Americans refered to
                    each other as "brother". Now, as far as punishment is concerned, punishments varied from tribe to tribe but generally did not involve physical
                    punishment. People that commited crimes or went against the tribe were usually shamed or rebuked in front of the tribe. In extreme cases 
                    they were expelled from the tribe.
