                    Although not technologically advanced, Native Americans had many theories about the supernatural
                    and many legends.

                    There many legends in which you can find Native American tribes actually living with wolf packs.
                    They managed to tame them somehow and they lived together with wolves. Native Americans believed
                    that wolves are closely related to them because every warrior of the tribe can transform into a wolf
                    with power granted from the spirits.
                </p><br>
                
                <p>
                    Wolf is considered a medicine being associated with power courage, strength, loyalty, and success at hunting.
                    Like bears, wolves are considered closely related to humans by many North American tribes, and the origin stories
                    of some Northwest Coast tribes, such as the Quileute and the Kwakiutl tell of their first ancestors being transformed
                    form wolves to men and vice versa.
                </p><br>
                
                <p>
                    The Navajo word for wolf , "mai-coh", also means witch and a person could transform if he or she donned a wolf skin. Native
                    American tribes have an overwhelming tendency to look upon the wolf in a very favorable light. The Navajo themselves
                    have healing ceremonies which call upon Powers to restore Peace and Harmony to the ill and the wolf is one such Power. 
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Native American tribes recognized the wolf for its extreme devotion to its family and many drew parallels between wolf pack
                    members and the members of the tribe. Also, the wolf's superior and cooperative hunting skills made it the envy of many tribes.
                    Finally, the wolf was known to defend its home against outsiders, a task with which each tribe had to contend as well.

                <h3><u>Folklore and Urban Legends</u></h3>
                <h4><u>5)Camazotz: The Death Bat</u></h4>
                <p>
                    This ferocious creature originates with the Ancient Mayans, who depicted him as powerful god-monster from the helish domain of
                    Xibalba, where he presides over swarms of bloodthirsty varmpire-bats. Though powerful enough to destroy entire civilizations Camazotz,
                    made a treaty with human beings to bring them fire but in exchange he demanded human sacrifices.

                <h4><u>4)Skudakumooch: The Ghost-Witch</u></h4>
                <p>
                    One of the scariest figures in Passamaquoddy and Micmac mythology, the Ghost-Witch is often said to be born from the dead body of a Shaman
                    who practiced black magic; the demonic entity then emerges each night with murder on it's mind. They can be killed with fire, but beware if
                    approaching one: simply making eye contact or hearing the witch's voice can bring a diabolical curse down on the unwary.

                <h4><u>3)Tah-tah-kle'-ah: The Owl-Women</u></h4>
                <p>
                    From the Yakama tribe come tales of five supernatural women who resemble giant owls, dwelling in caves by day and flying out at night to prey
                    on all manner of creatures - including humans. In fact, it is said that they prefer the taste of children. Legend has it they can hunt humans
                    by mimicking their language. The owl itself is a symbol of death in many native cultures, so owl-women are a essentialy a walking embodiment
                    of death itself.

                <h4><u>2)Teihiihan: The Little Cannibals</u></h4>
                <p>
                    Among the most dreaded figures in Cheyenne and Arapaho legends(and more), these savage humanoids may be child-sized but they are incredibly strong
                    and often attack in large numbers. According to some myths the Teihiihan were fearsome warriors in a previous life, ressurected as dwarves after dying
                    in battle. Most of those tales say they were finally wiped out by an alliance of several tribes.

                <h4><u>1)Wendigo: The Evil That Devours</u></h4>
                <p>
                    In Algonquian folklore, the wendigo is a mythical cannibal monster or evil spirit native to the northern forests of the Atlantic Coast and Great Lakes Region
                    of both the United States and Canada. The Wendigo may appear as a monster with some characteristics of a human, or as a spirit who has possesed a human being
                    and made them become monstrous. It is historically associated with cannibalism, murder, insatiable greed and the cultural taboos against such behaviours by claiming
                    that any human who eats another's flesh will be transformed into a creature of pure evil. Not even loved ones are safe from their eternal hunger.
